# Project: Game Collection Builder/Manager

## App Title:
### The Player's Vault

## App Description:
### To some of us, collecting games is big business. Whether you have a shelf full of the latest favorites or a collection dating back to your childhood occupying boxes in your basement my app will help with logging that collection. Information will be available that includes data on each title and will include a feature that stores your collection for future reference helping you keep a working inventory of your investment for years to come.

    "description": "<p>Rockstar Games went bigger, since their previous installment of the series. You get the complicated and realistic world-building from Liberty City of GTA4 in the setting of lively and diverse Los Santos, from an old fan favorite GTA San Andreas. 561 different vehicles (including every transport you can operate) and the amount is rising with every update. <br />\nSimultaneous storytelling from three unique perspectives: <br />\nFollow Michael, ex-criminal living his life of leisure away from the past, Franklin, a kid that seeks the better future, and Trevor, the exact past Michael is trying to run away from. <br />\nGTA Online will provide a lot of additional challenge even for the experienced players, coming fresh from the story mode. Now you will have other players around that can help you just as likely as ruin your mission. Every GTA mechanic up to date can be experienced by players through the unique customizable character, and community content paired with the leveling system tends to keep everyone busy and engaged.</p>",

## MVP:
### The app will allow users to search for titles and will provide select bits of data on the title. Users will also have the ability to save these titles to a personal library acting as an inventory, a wishlist, or just a collection of favorites.

## Post-MVP:
### Would like to incorporate a pricing guide to assist with valuing the collection. An outside API may be necessary for this.
